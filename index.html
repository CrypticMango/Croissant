    <p>A croissant is a buttery, crescent-shaped French pastry. Good croissants are light, flaky, and delicately sweet. Enjoy one with a cup of coffee — preferably while sitting in a charming Parisian cafe. My personal favourite is when you slice one in half and put some egg, cheese and a piece of ham on it and make a breakfast sandwich. Try it sometime, you won't regret it!</p>
